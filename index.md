## About
I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Prior to joining UNO, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Advanced Research in Software Engineering (ARiSE) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Virginia Tech. Before entering academia, I held software engineering and research staff positions in industry, including roles at Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics.

My research focuses on software engineering and program analysis, with an emphasis on AI- and large language model (LLM)-assisted software development, software correctness and security, and automated program understanding and transformation. My recent work explores how learning-based techniques can be combined with program analysis to support software reliability, robustness, and developer productivity, particularly in educational and security-sensitive contexts.
