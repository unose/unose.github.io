<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  I am an <span class="bio-highlight">Associate Professor</span> in the Department of Computer Science at the <span class="bio-highlight">University of Nebraska at Omaha</span>. Prior to joining UNO, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Advanced Research in Software Engineering (ARiSE) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at <span class="bio-highlight">The University of Texas at Austin</span>. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from <span class="bio-highlight">Virginia Tech</span>. Before entering academia, I held software engineering and research staff positions in industry, including roles at <span class="bio-highlight">Samsung Electronics</span> and <span class="bio-highlight">LG Electronics</span>.
</p>
<p>
  My research focuses on <span class="bio-highlight">software engineering</span> and <span class="bio-highlight">program analysis</span>, with an emphasis on AI- and large language model (LLM)-assisted software development, software correctness and security, and automated program understanding and transformation. My recent work explores how <span class="bio-highlight">learning-based techniques</span> can be combined with program analysis to support software reliability, robustness, and developer productivity, particularly in educational and security-sensitive contexts.

    <strong>Nov 20, 2025</strong> – <strong>Shradha Maharjan</strong> (M.S. student, Computer Science) successfully defended her master’s thesis titled
    <em>“Transformer-Based Deep Learning for Context-Aware Code Completion via Large Language Model Enhancement.”</em>
    Advised by <strong>Dr. Myoungkyu Song</strong>, the thesis introduces <strong>DEEPCC</strong>, a transformer-based framework that integrates
    <strong>program analysis</strong> and <strong>multi-task learning</strong> into a <strong>large language model</strong> for context-aware code completion,
    demonstrating statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.
