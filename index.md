<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  I am an <span class="bio-highlight">Associate Professor</span> in the Department of Computer Science at the <span class="bio-highlight">University of Nebraska at Omaha</span>. Prior to joining UNO, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Advanced Research in Software Engineering (ARiSE) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at <span class="bio-highlight">The University of Texas at Austin</span>. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from <span class="bio-highlight">Virginia Tech</span>. Before entering academia, I held software engineering and research staff positions in industry, including roles at <span class="bio-highlight">Samsung Electronics</span> and <span class="bio-highlight">LG Electronics</span>.
</p>
<p>
  My research focuses on <span class="bio-highlight">software engineering</span> and <span class="bio-highlight">program analysis</span>, with an emphasis on AI- and large language model (LLM)-assisted software development, software correctness and security, and automated program understanding and transformation. My recent work explores how <span class="bio-highlight">learning-based techniques</span> can be combined with program analysis to support software reliability, robustness, and developer productivity, particularly in educational and security-sensitive contexts.
