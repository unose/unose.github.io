# Research

## Research Overview

My research focuses on **software engineering** and **program analysis**, with the goal of improving the **reliability**, **maintainability**, and **developer productivity** of real-world software systems.  
I am particularly interested in combining **automated analysis** with **learning-based techniques**, including **large language models (LLMs)**, to support developers across the software lifecycle.
