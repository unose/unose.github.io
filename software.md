<h1>Software</h1>

<p>
This page lists <strong>research software and prototypes</strong> developed as part of my
research in <strong>software engineering</strong>, <strong>program analysis</strong>, and
<strong>intelligent systems for programming support</strong>, including
both <strong>program-analysis–based</strong> and <strong>AI-assisted</strong> approaches.
Unless otherwise noted, these systems are <em>research prototypes</em>.

<h2>SSD Tutor</h2>

<p>
<strong>SSD Tutor</strong> — First-stage research prototype for program-analysis–based
instruction in secure software development.

</p>

<p>
SSD Tutor represents the <strong>first stage</strong> of our research on
feedback-driven support for programming education.
It is an interactive tutoring system that leverages
<strong>program analysis</strong> to help students understand
<strong>software design</strong>, <strong>debugging</strong>, and
<strong>secure coding principles</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The system analyzes student code submissions to identify design flaws,
logic errors, and security-relevant issues, and provides
<strong>precise, actionable feedback</strong> grounded in static analysis results.
SSD Tutor serves as a foundational platform for studying how
program analysis can be effectively integrated into educational tools
to improve learning outcomes in software engineering and security.
